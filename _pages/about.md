I'm a graduate student and ICARE trainee at the University of Maryland Baltimore County, under the Geography & Environmental Systems Department.


My Environmental & Career Goals
======

Growing up in Baltimore City and County, I was always interested in the local marine
and terrestrial environments, which inspired me to major in Environmental Studies with a
concentration in Conservation and Environmental Management at UMBC for my undergraduate
degree. Ultimately, my career goal is to evolve into an African American leader, focused on
restoring the Baltimore Inner Harbor, and the surrounding regions. To achieve this goal, I want to earn a masterâ€™s degree through the ICARE Program at UMBC, in Geography and Environmental Systems. Restoring the Inner Harbor back to homeostasis will attract more tourists, boosting city funds that can contribute towards fixing environmental problems and implementing improved environmental policies. I want inner city children to appreciate the environment and value the importance of keeping our communities clean. 

The ICARE Program will provide me with the environmental management education necessary for ecosystem health and natural resource positions in the Chesapeake region. My focus will be centered around the connected interactions between ecosystem functions, ecological health, and sustainability. I want to develop scientific, analytical, and quantitative assessment skills to create new solutions to counter excessive limiting nutrients caused by anthropogenic pollution. I hope to establish new counter-pollution practices to decrease the amount of physical, chemical, biological, and cultural hazards entering the inner-harbor. I also want to contribute to developing innovative sustainable infrastructures to improve urban environments that may be vulnerable to environmental degradation and  urban biodiversity loss.

Through the ICARE program, I hope to enhance my ecosystem health assessment skills and gain accredited scientific knowledge to guide natural resource practices and conservation activities that directly impact Chesapeake Bay restoration.
My goal is to use my newfound understanding to become an advocate to improve ecosystem health through sustainable practices, connecting Baltimore City, the Inner Harbor, and the Chesapeake Bay. Provided the opportunity to focus on Ecosystem Health and Natural Resource Management through the ICARE program, I would be able to make my dreams a reality by delving into cutting edge natural resource management research.
