Background information: Air quality is still a concern for Baltimore residents. There isnâ€™t an air quality sensor network or any data in Baltimore to collect and compare. There aren't any resources or current grants for quality EPA grade air sensors. Lake Montebello is the only air quality sensor location.
1.	Growing network of crowd source networking (e.g., Purple Air sensors and the growing network there) - but not necessarily equally distributed throughout urban centers in order to capture variability in air pollution and air quality.
2.	Interested in seeing if trees as bioindicators are a potential monitoring option for diversifying and distributing the air pollution monitoring network in urban areas.
