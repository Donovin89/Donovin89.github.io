Background information: Air quality is still a concern for Baltimore residents. There isnâ€™t an air quality sensor network or any data in Baltimore to collect and compare. There aren't any resources or current grants for quality EPA grade air sensors. Lake Montebello is the only air quality sensor location.
1.	Growing network of crowd source networking (e.g., Purple Air sensors and the growing network there) - but not necessarily equally distributed throughout urban centers in order to capture variability in air pollution and air quality.
2.	Interested in seeing if trees as bioindicators are a potential monitoring option for diversifying and distributing the air pollution monitoring network in urban areas.

### Tree and Traffic Pattern Analysis 
![Map 1]("images/Final_Map1.PNG")
This is important because the only EPA grade air sensor is located in Lake Montebello. This particular area is not the best location to install an air quality sensor. There are areas in Baltimore city with denser traffic and less percent area coverage of trees. The community that surrounds lake Montebello is a middle-class community. With all the environmental justice issues that encompasses air equality and air pollution, there are other sections of Baltimore city such as West and South Baltimore that need an EPA air sensor more than lake Montebello. Not to mention, the trash incinerator and CSX Transportation coal plant in South Baltimore. These locations have minimal tree density and would be good locations to request a grant for a new street tree initiative program. Street trees can lower urban air temperature, reduce harmful pollutants, and improve public health extreme weather events.
