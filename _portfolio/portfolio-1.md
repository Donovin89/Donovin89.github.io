Background information: Air quality is still a concern for Baltimore residents. There isn’t an air quality sensor network or any data in Baltimore to collect and compare. There aren't any resources or current grants for quality EPA grade air sensors. Lake Montebello is the only air quality sensor location.
1.	Growing network of crowd source networking (e.g., Purple Air sensors and the growing network there) - but not necessarily equally distributed throughout urban centers in order to capture variability in air pollution and air quality.
2.	Interested in seeing if trees as bioindicators are a potential monitoring option for diversifying and distributing the air pollution monitoring network in urban areas.

### Tree and Traffic Pattern Analysis

This is important because the only EPA grade air sensor is located in Lake Montebello. This particular area is not the best location to install an air quality sensor. There are areas in Baltimore city with denser traffic and less percent area coverage of trees. The community that surrounds lake Montebello is a middle-class community. With all the environmental justice issues that encompasses air equality and air pollution, there are other sections of Baltimore city such as West and South Baltimore that need an EPA air sensor more than lake Montebello. Not to mention, the trash incinerator and CSX Transportation coal plant in South Baltimore. These locations have minimal tree density and would be good locations to request a grant for a new street tree initiative program. Street trees can lower urban air temperature, reduce harmful pollutants, and improve public health extreme weather events. 

### Tree Bioindicator Species & Traffic Density

For my thesis project my focus will be using or potentially using trees as bioindicators for air quality. Biological indicators or bioindicators are living organisms (microbes, animals and plants) that are used as a potential tool to monitor the changes (either positive or negative) in environmental health and their possible impact on human civilization (Azzazy, 2020). Baltimore air pollution levels result from Ozone (O3) and fine particulates (PM 2. 5). These pollutants are Maryland's biggest air barriers when looking at air quality. Both pollutants are created from fuel-burning sources such as vehicles, electric utilities and industrial boilers. This map analyzes traffic density in Baltimore city and joins tree bioindicator species. Tilia Europaea. Ash Europea, Hackberry common, Locust Black, Maple Norway are tree species in Baltimore city that are most sensitive to air quality that have the best potential to monitor air quality.This is important because it’s only one air sensor located in Baltimore city. Developing an alternative air monitoring network system would help gather results from research to show policy makers that Baltimore officials have to do more to establish healthier air qualities around the city. Even though this issue isn’t a priority to the EPA, Baltimore state and local officials have the power to improve air quality by developing alternative sustainable methods for air quality improvement.
