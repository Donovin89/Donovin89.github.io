In Baltimore, the correlation between educational attainment and median income is multifaceted and dynamic. At its core, the level of education individuals attain significantly impacts their earning potential and economic mobility. Areas with higher concentrations of residents achieving higher education degrees tend to exhibit higher median incomes, illustrating a positive correlation between educational attainment and economic prosperity. Conversely, neighborhoods with lower educational attainment levels often experience lower median incomes, exacerbating socio-economic inequalities.

The relationship extends beyond individual achievements to systemic factors such as school quality, access to resources, and workforce development initiatives. Disparities in educational opportunities across Baltimore's diverse neighborhoods contribute to varying levels of economic success. For instance, neighborhoods with well-funded schools and robust community support systems generally see higher graduation rates and better preparedness for higher education or skilled employment, thereby supporting higher median incomes among their residents.

Moreover, the impact of educational disparities on median income is compounded by historical and structural inequities, including housing segregation, economic disinvestment, and limited access to healthcare and social services. These factors create a complex web of challenges that perpetuate socio-economic disparities and influence the educational outcomes and economic prospects of Baltimore's residents.

In addressing these challenges, understanding the relationship map between education and median income is crucial for implementing targeted policies and initiatives aimed at fostering educational equity and economic opportunity across all communities in Baltimore. By investing in educational resources, promoting workforce development, and addressing systemic barriers, Baltimore can work towards a future where educational achievement serves as a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and prosperity for all residents.

Background information: Air quality is still a concern for Baltimore residents. There isnâ€™t an air quality sensor network or any data in Baltimore to collect and compare. There aren't any resources or current grants for quality EPA grade air sensors. Lake Montebello is the only air quality sensor location.
1.	Growing network of crowd source networking (e.g., Purple Air sensors and the growing network there) - but not necessarily equally distributed throughout urban centers in order to capture variability in air pollution and air quality.
2.	Interested in seeing if trees as bioindicators are a potential monitoring option for diversifying and distributing the air pollution monitoring network in urban areas.
