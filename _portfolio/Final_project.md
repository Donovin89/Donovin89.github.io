## Monitoring Air Pollution from CSX 

![MAP1](../images/SERCSAirSensors2PollutionCSX.png)
#### Current Air Quality Monitoring Challenges: CSX

Baltimore's traditional air quality monitoring systems need more coverage and dispersion throughout the city, limiting their ability to discern particulate matter and distinct toxic metals effectively. This gap underscores the need for innovative approaches to supplement existing monitoring efforts. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) proposes a novel method: utilizing tree-leaf surfaces as bioindicators of air pollution.

#### Utilizing Tree-Leaf Surfaces as Bioindicators

Using tree leaves as indicators of air quality leverages the ability of vegetation to absorb and accumulate airborne pollutants. This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods:

#### Spatial Resolution: 

A finer spatial resolution can be achieved than centralized monitoring stations by strategically placing sensors on tree leaves across different locations.

#### Cost-effectiveness: 

Deploying leaf-based sensors is potentially more cost-effective than establishing new fixed monitoring stations, particularly in underserved areas.

#### Environmental Awareness: 

Engaging local communities in monitoring tree health and pollutant accumulation can raise environmental awareness and foster community involvement in pollution mitigation efforts.

These locations are strategically chosen to ensure comprehensive coverage across diverse urban environments, including areas with high concentrations of marginalized communities. This spatial distribution aims to capture variations in heavy metal pollution levels that may correlate with socioeconomic factors, providing valuable insights into environmental justice issues.

#### Addressing Health Disparities

The correlation between heavy metal pollution and adverse health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations, underscores the urgency of this research. By correlating the data collected from tree-leaf surfaces with health statistics, policymakers can better understand the environmental factors contributing to health disparities. This understanding is essential for implementing targeted interventions and policies to reduce exposure and improve public health outcomes in Baltimore's underserved communities.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, using tree-leaf surfaces as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution represents a promising approach to enhance air quality monitoring in Baltimore. By expanding the monitoring network to include these innovative sensors, SERC aims to advance our understanding of environmental pollution and its impact on public health. This interdisciplinary approach not only contributes to scientific knowledge but also holds the potential to catalyze meaningful change in environmental policy and community health initiatives.




## Heavy Metal Pollution from Baltimore's Incinerator: Integrating Air Sensors and Tree Leaf Surfaces for Effective Monitoring

![MAP2](../images/PollutionSourceIncinerator.png)

Baltimore, Maryland, faces significant environmental challenges, particularly regarding heavy metal pollution from sources such as the Wheelabrator Baltimore incinerator. This issue is exacerbated by its potential health impacts on nearby communities, necessitating robust monitoring and intervention strategies. Integrating air sensors with tree leaf surface analysis, proposed by the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC), presents a promising approach to assess and mitigate heavy metal pollution comprehensively.

#### Understanding Heavy Metal Pollution from the Incinerator
The Wheelabrator Baltimore incinerator, located at 1801 Annapolis Rd, is a focal point for heavy metal emissions in the region. Incinerators release pollutants such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic into the atmosphere through combustion. These pollutants can settle on nearby surfaces, including vegetation like tree leaves and bioindicators of environmental contamination.

#### Importance of Co-Locating Air Sensors and Tree Leaf Samples

My approach involves strategically placing air sensors alongside locations where tree leaf samples are collected. This co-location allows for simultaneous monitoring of atmospheric pollutants and their accumulation on vegetation, offering several advantages:

#### Comprehensive Data Collection: 

A complete understanding of heavy metal distribution and environmental dynamics can be achieved by combining air sensor data with leaf surface analysis.

#### Spatial Correlation: 

Co-located sensors and leaf samples enable spatial correlation analysis, identifying pollution concentration hotspots and potential exposure pathways.

#### Validation and Calibration: 

Comparing air sensor readings with leaf sample analyses provides a means to validate and calibrate sensor measurements, enhancing data accuracy and reliability.

#### Potential Air Sensor Locations and Their Significance

Bay Brook Elementary/Middle School: Positioned at 4301 10th Street, an area potentially affected by proximity to industrial emissions.
Lakeland Community and STEAM Center: Located at 2921 Stranden Road, serving as a community hub where pollution impacts could affect vulnerable populations.
MAG Building (ALL of Baltimore Peninsula): Found at 321 E Cromwell St, providing coverage in a densely populated urban area.
IMET: Positioned at 701 E Pratt St, focusing on urban industrial impacts near the Inner Harbor.
City Garage: Situated at 101 W Dickman St, an area where industrial and vehicular emissions may contribute to pollution levels.
West Covington Park: Located at 101 W Cromwell St, a green space potentially affected by urban pollution sources.
Middle Branch Park Boathouse and Middle Branch Marina: Positioned at 3301 and 3101 Waterview Ave, respectively, monitoring impacts along the waterfront.
Masonville Cove: Found at 1000 Frankfurst Ave, near industrial and residential areas.
Intersection of Change/Strength to Love II Farm: Located at 1855 Kavanaugh St, focusing on community gardens and urban agriculture.
Baltimore Community Tool Bank: Positioned at 1224 Wicomico St, near residential and industrial interfaces.

These locations are selected to ensure coverage across diverse urban environments, prioritizing areas where vulnerable populations reside or frequent, thereby addressing potential disparities in exposure and health outcomes.

#### Advancing Environmental Health and Policy Interventions

Integrating air sensors and tree leaf surface analysis represents a critical advancement in environmental monitoring and public health policy. By generating comprehensive, localized data on heavy metal pollution, this approach empowers policymakers to implement targeted interventions and regulations. Such measures are essential for reducing environmental injustices and improving the quality of life for all Baltimore residents, particularly those in underserved communities.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, integrated monitoring systems combining air sensors and tree leaf surface analysis hold immense potential for addressing heavy metal pollution from sources like the Wheelabrator incinerator in Baltimore, Maryland. This approach enhances our understanding of pollution dynamics and supports evidence-based policy decisions aimed at safeguarding public health and promoting environmental justice. As efforts continue to evolve, collaboration between scientific research, community engagement, and regulatory actions will be pivotal in achieving sustainable urban environments with improved air quality standards.
