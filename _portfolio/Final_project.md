## Monitoring Air Pollution from CSX 


#### Current Air Quality Monitoring Challenges: CSX

Baltimore's traditional air quality monitoring systems need more coverage and dispersion throughout the city, limiting their ability to discern particulate matter and distinct toxic metals effectively. This gap underscores the need for innovative approaches to supplement existing monitoring efforts. The Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) proposes a novel method: utilizing tree-leaf surfaces as bioindicators of air pollution.

#### Utilizing Tree-Leaf Surfaces as Bioindicators

Using tree leaves as indicators of air quality leverages the ability of vegetation to absorb and accumulate airborne pollutants. This approach offers several advantages over traditional methods:

#### Spatial Resolution: 

A finer spatial resolution can be achieved than centralized monitoring stations by strategically placing sensors on tree leaves across different locations.

#### Cost-effectiveness: 

Deploying leaf-based sensors is potentially more cost-effective than establishing new fixed monitoring stations, particularly in underserved areas.

#### Environmental Awareness: 

Engaging local communities in monitoring tree health and pollutant accumulation can raise environmental awareness and foster community involvement in pollution mitigation efforts.

These locations are strategically chosen to ensure comprehensive coverage across diverse urban environments, including areas with high concentrations of marginalized communities. This spatial distribution aims to capture variations in heavy metal pollution levels that may correlate with socioeconomic factors, providing valuable insights into environmental justice issues.

#### Addressing Health Disparities

The correlation between heavy metal pollution and adverse health outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations, underscores the urgency of this research. By correlating the data collected from tree-leaf surfaces with health statistics, policymakers can better understand the environmental factors contributing to health disparities. This understanding is essential for implementing targeted interventions and policies to reduce exposure and improve public health outcomes in Baltimore's underserved communities.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, using tree-leaf surfaces as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution represents a promising approach to enhance air quality monitoring in Baltimore. By expanding the monitoring network to include these innovative sensors, SERC aims to advance our understanding of environmental pollution and its impact on public health. This interdisciplinary approach not only contributes to scientific knowledge but also holds the potential to catalyze meaningful change in environmental policy and community health initiatives.
